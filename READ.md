# School Tools
School Tools was created to protect the privacy of students in Schools. School Tools is a google extension that every hour clears cache, cookies and history. The main focus for this extension is to clear cookies which in other words is login data. In my years in high school & elementary school a big issue has been students forgetting to logout of a program, whether this be office 365, our grading system, anything. Not logging out meant other people who used the school laptops were able to access other students accounts to be able to see their grades, addresses, phone numbers, documents, private messages between teacher and students.
